# lazy tools
 I hate doing repeated and boring things. I'm willing to spend a lot of time to write some scripts to do it automatically. Then, next time, we just need to press `Enter`, take a coffee cup and enjoy the expected results
 
 ### List of tools
 - [Gittool](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/lazy/tree/master/git): say "bye" to github webpage, except doing code review. Just need to change my code then say "done", gittool will do the rest (commit, push to remote, create pull request, ask a review from other members, add label review)
 - [Scripts when I work at TomoChain](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/lazy/tree/master/tomochain): `startPC && tomup` to start everything I need when I work at TomoChain
 - [Scripts when I work at Zalora](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/lazy/tree/master/zalora) `startPC` to start everything I need when I work at Zalora
 - [Custom terminal](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/lazy/tree/master/custom_terminal): make my terminal more interesting
 - [Checkin bot](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/check-in): TomoChain allows to work from home due to COVID-19 . But I need to check-in, check-out to a slack channel. This bot helps me to do those stuffs
 - [Git reminder](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/git-reminder): at 16:00 GMT+07 every weekdays, remind me all issues assigned to me, all PRs waiting for my review
 - [TomoChain node healthcheck](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/tomochain-node-healthcheck): send me alerts via slack/telegram if my TomoChain node is slow or down
 - [Late-registration-bot](https://github.com/thanhnguyennguyen/check-in/tree/master/late-registration) when it's rain, I potentially go to work late. I need to register for late working to avoid a penalty. This bot help me to do that
