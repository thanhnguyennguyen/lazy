# lazy tools
 I hate doing repeated and bored things. I'm okay to spend a lot of time to write some scripts just in case I do something more than twice.
 It should be exactly done by my computer.
 
 - start_mac.sh: add this script to startup to automatically launch necessary applications when you start your Mac
 - start_ubuntu: add this script to startup to automatically launch necessary applications when you start your PC
 - gittool.sh: automatically commit your code and push to remote github repo (Remember to add stages in advance), start your review.
 You should alias by this command: 
 ```
 alias gittool="path/to/gittool.sh"
 ```
